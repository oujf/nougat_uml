    // In practice, the android core seems to have a hard time hitting its frame
    // cadence consistently.  Sometimes the frames are on time, and sometimes
    // they are even a little early, but more often than not, the frames are
    // late by about a full output frame time.

    // ATV pretty much always uses a 60fps output rate, and the only thing
    // consuming the latency estimate provided by the HAL is the path handling
    // AV sync.  For now, we can fudge this number to move things back in the
    // direction of correct by providing a setting for video delay compensation
    // which will be subtracted from the latency estimate and defaulting it to
    // a reasonable middle gound (12mSec in this case).
